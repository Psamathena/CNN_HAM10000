# CNN Model for HAM10000 Dataset

## Overview
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed for skin lesion classification using the HAM10000 dataset. The model aims to classify dermatoscopic images into different categories of skin diseases.

## Dataset
The HAM10000 dataset consists of 10,000 dermatoscopic images categorized into 7 classes of skin lesions. Each image is labeled with the corresponding diagnosis.

### Classes:
1. Melanoma (MEL)
2. Melanocytic nevus (NV)
3. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC)
4. Actinic keratosis (AKIEC)
5. Benign keratosis (BKL)
6. Dermatofibroma (DF)
7. Vascular lesion (VASC)

## Model Architecture
The CNN model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and includes the following layers:
- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- Max-pooling layers
- Dropout layers for regularization
- Fully connected layers
- Softmax output layer for multi-class classification

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cnn_model_ham10000.git
   cd cnn_model_ham10000
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Download the HAM10000 dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.
2. Preprocess the data using the provided scripts:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
4. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

## Results
The model achieves the following performance metrics on the test set:
- Accuracy: ~95%
- Precision: ~94%
- Recall: ~93%
- F1-score: ~93%
